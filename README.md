The TV animation:
The actual source of it comes from the video game "Art of Fighting" by SNK. The link to the video is here:

I had to convert the gif to an mp4, and I did so with this online tool: https://ezgif.com/

Report:

I built my own version of this project on top of the project provided by Mr. VInh Nguyen. The main modifications that I
made involved removing old models, adding new models of my own, resizing the room, specifically in half. I figured a fast
and easy way to add models was to add a handful of them to the shelf.
